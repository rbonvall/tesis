\chapter{GPU implementation}
\label{ch:implementation}

This chapter describes how the simulation was implemented on the GPU.

The reference algorithm for evaluating
this kind of computation on the GPU
is the one by Nyland et.~al~\cite[\S31]{gems3},
which shows how to integrate a body system
subject to gravitational interactions.

\section{Work distribution}
\label{sec:work-distribution}

The simulation of the Lamb-Oseen vortex
with the algorithm described in chapter~\ref{ch:vm-design}
amounts to the numerical integration
of the convection and diffusion equations
for each of the~\(N\) particles of the system:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:x-integration}
    x_p^{(n + 1)} &= x_p^{(n)} + u_p^{(n)}\, δt, \\
    \label{eq:y-integration}
    y_p^{(n + 1)} &= y_p^{(n)} + v_p^{(n)}\, δt, \\
    \label{eq:a-integration}
    α_p^{(n + 1)} &= α_p^{(n)} + \dot{α}_p^{(n)}\, δt.
\end{align}

At every time step~\(n\),
and for every particle~\(p\),
the values of \(u_p\), \(v_p\) and \(\dot{α}_p\)
must be evaluated as a function of all other particles
using the Biot-Savart law and the Particle Strength Exchange formula:
\begin{align}
    %\label{eq:evaluation}
%    (u_p, v_p) &= \sum_q α_p \K_ε(\x_p - \x_q) \\
%    \dot{α}_p  &= νε^{-2} \sum_q [α_q - α_p]\,η_ε(\x_p - \x_q)
    \label{eq:bs-sum}
    (u_p, v_p) &= \sum_q \vec{U}_{pq},   & \text{where } \vec{U}_{pq} &= α_p \K_ε(\x_p - \x_q), \text{and} \\
    \label{eq:pse-sum}
    \dot{α}_p  &= νε^{-2} \sum_q A_{pq}, & \text{where }       A_{pq} &= [α_q - α_p]\,η_ε(\x_p - \x_q).
\end{align}
Sums~\eqref{eq:bs-sum} and~\eqref{eq:pse-sum} can be computed
independently among particles,
provided that the descriptions~\(x_q, y_q, α_q\)
for all the particles are available.

On the GPU, thus,
each thread is assigned the tasks
of computing sums~\eqref{eq:bs-sum} and~\eqref{eq:pse-sum} for one particle,
and of updating the particle description
according to equations~\eqref{eq:x-integration},
\eqref{eq:y-integration} and~\eqref{eq:a-integration}.

The~\(N\) threads are grouped in \(B\)~blocks of \(T = N/B\)~threads
(for the time being, let us assume that~\(B\mid N\)).
All threads within a block execute concurrently
(but not necessarily simultaneously),
while all blocks are scheduled independent of each other
to be executed when multiprocessors are available.

Thread~\(t\) in block~\(b\) evaluates \(\vec u_p\) and \(\dot{α}_p\)
for particle~\(p = bT + t\).
Conversely,
particle~\(p\) is evaluated by thread~\(t = p\bmod T\)
in block~\(b = \lfloor p/T \rfloor\).

Figure~\ref{fig:nbody-tiles} shows a schematic representation
of the distribution of work among threads.
All of the~\(N^2\) particle interactions are represented
as cells in the finer grid.
Each thread computes interactions sequentially along a row.
In this example, blocks 1 through 4 are already in execution,
while the others have not started yet.

\section{Memory management}
\label{sec:memory-management}

Throughout the simulation,
the current state of the particle system
is stored in an array of particles in global memory,
where each particle is described as a 3-tuple~\((x_p, y_p, α_p)\).

On Nvidia GPUs,
global memory reads are always~\emph{coalesced} (accessed in chunks)
and \emph{aligned} to chunk boundaries\fbox{CITE}.
Unaligned accesses imposes a performance penalty,
since more chunks must be fetched
when data spills across boundaries.

Since chunks are aligned to addresses that are
multiples of 32, 64 or 128 (depending of the chunk size),
accesses are more efficient when particles are stored
as values of type~\texttt{float4} instead of~\texttt{float3}
(records of resp.\@ four and three single-precision floating point values)
whose fourth field is kept unused.


\section{Kernel implementation}
\label{sec:kernel-implementation}

The main global kernel is called \verb!integrate!.

The pseudocode is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
GLOBAL KERNEL integrate(dt, N, old_particles, new_particles)
    p = id of particle associated to current thread
    IF p < N THEN
        particle = old_particles[p]
        derivatives = eval_derivatives(particle, old_particles, N)
        particle = particle + derivatives * dt
        new_particles[p] = particle
    END IF
END KERNEL
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
KERNEL eval_derivatives(current_particle, particles, N)
    shared_particles = shared array of particles
    t = current thread id
    num_tiles = ceiling(N / T)

    derivatives = (0, 0, 0)
    FOR tile = 0 TO num_tiles - 1 DO
        shared_particles[t] = particles[tile * T + t]
        synchronize()
        derivatives = update_tile(particle, derivatives)
        synchronize()
    END FOR

    RETURN derivatives
END KERNEL
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
KERNEL update_tile(particle, derivatives)
    shared_particles = shared array of particles
    t = current thread id

    i = 0
    counter = 0
    WHILE counter < block_size
        derivatives = particle_interaction(derivatives,
                particle,
                shared_particles[i + block_size * t])
        i = i + 1
        counter = counter + 1
    END WHILE

    derivatives.z = derivatives.z * nu/e^2
    RETURN derivatives
END KERNEL
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
KERNEL particle_interaction(derivatives, p, q)
    r = p - q
    velocity_kernel_factor = k_factor(r^2)
    derivatives.x += velocity_kernel_factor * -r.y
    derivatives.y += velocity_kernel_factor *  r.x
    derivatives.z += (q.z - p.z) * eta(r^2)
END KERNEL
\end{verbatim}
